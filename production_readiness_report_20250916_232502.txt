RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCTION:
1. 🚨 Fix all critical failures before deploying to production
2. 📊 Consider upgrading to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production
3. 🔒 Enable HTTPS for production deployment
4. 🔄 Set up automated backups for production database
5. 📊 Configure monitoring and logging for production
6. 🚀 Use a production WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
7. 🔧 Set up health check endpoints for load balancers
8. 🛡️  Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
9. 📈 Set up error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar)
